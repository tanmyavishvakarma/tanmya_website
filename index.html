                        <p>Hi, I am Tanmya Vishvakarma(You probably know that by now) and I am on my way of becoming a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>. Currently I am proficient in Python and Java with C,GO and Kotlin on the side.I love developing Android Application using Android Studio but right now trying to learn cross platform development using Flutter.I am also well versed in MySQL as I created a database system while I was in School. Coming to OS's have used Linux quite frequently but would really like to improve my skills from a user level to expert level. My favorite Linux Distribution has to Linux Mint but I am currently testing ActiveX Linux for a few days now and have to say I'm impressed maybe one day it will be my daily driver.Another Linux DIstribution that I adore is Kali Linux.I havent given Kali my fair share of time but its mostly because kali is inclined more towards cybersecurity then developing and as of right now I am all about making projects. </p>
